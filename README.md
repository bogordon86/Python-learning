## PyPoll

![Vote-Counting](Images/Vote_counting.jpg)

I helped to update a town's voting count process using two sets of poll data (`election_data_1.csv` and `election_data_2.csv`). Each dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.  Utilizing Python, I analyzed the votes and calculated the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.


## PyParagraph

![Language](Images/language.jpg)

Utilizes a simple set of metrics for assessing complexity of various passages.

This was accomplished in Python by:

* Importing a text file filled with a paragraph.

* Asessing the paragraph selection for each of the following:

  * Approximate word count

  * Approximate sentence count

  * Approximate letter count (per word)

  * Average sentence length (in words)
